This type of testing tends to result in very brittle tests, where test implementation is tightly coupled to the implementation of the code being tested.</p><p>This is an extremely common failure mode for codebases on Agile projects, where the tests become increasingly a constraint on change rather than enabling it because refactoring the code requires altering the tightly coupled tests and so becomes both time-consuming and error-prone.</p><p>An interesting aside in favour of agile development techniques in general and TDD in particular is that even in this state the code is often much more robust and a much better functional fit than code developed under more traditional methods based on large-scale up-front design.</p><p>Advanced TDD practitioners realise that the tests are really about interactions between objects. These experts use mock objects [ref Mackinnon et al] to set and verify expectations about how objects will interact. The state becomes a side-issue. TDD code written in this way is characterized by narrow, well-named interfaces describing the roles objects play for one another. [ref Rebecca Wirfs-Brock].</p><p>Behaviour-Driven Programming jumps straight in to the interactions-and-roles stage, encouraging developers to think of the behaviour of the component that they are developing, and of the roles and responsibilities of the other objects it interacts with.</p><p>Each “test method” is called a “behaviour” and takes the form of a sentence saying what the object should do.</p><p>This is best illustrated by example so check <a href=/behaviourdrivenprogrammingexample>BehaviourDrivenProgrammingExample</a>.</p><div class=row></div></div></div></div><script src=lib/jquery.min.js></script><script src=lib/popper.min.js></script><script src=js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/plugins/lunr.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/plugins/auto-complete.js></script><link href=/plugins/auto-complete.css rel=stylesheet><script type=text/javascript>var baseurl="";</script><script type=text/javascript src=/plugins/search.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/plugins/clipboard.js></script><script>new ClipboardJS('.btn');</script></body></html>
