The reason that so many projects attempt to predict the future in this way is fear of the CostOfChange.</em></p><p>- DaveFarley in &ldquo;Intro To Agile Development&rdquo; (International Developer Magazine)</p><div class=row></div></div></div></div><script src=lib/jquery.min.js></script><script src=lib/popper.min.js></script><script src=js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/plugins/lunr.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/plugins/auto-complete.js></script><link href=/plugins/auto-complete.css rel=stylesheet><script type=text/javascript>var baseurl="";</script><script type=text/javascript src=/plugins/search.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/plugins/clipboard.js></script><script>new ClipboardJS('.btn');</script></body></html>
