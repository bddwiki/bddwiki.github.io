The BDD process looks like this:

A {{%wiki SubjectMatterExpert %}} (typically a business user) works with a {{%wiki BusinessAnalyst %}} to identify a business requirement. This is expressed as a story using the following template:

- As a **Role**
- I request a **Feature**
- To gain a **Benefit**

The speaker, who holds the _Role_, is the person who will gain the _Benefit_ from the requested _Feature_.

This can also be paraphrased variously as ...

1. I want to achieve a specific _Goal_, and as a _Role_ I should be able to accomplish this by performing _Functionality_.
2. A _Role_ invokes _Feature_ to cause a _Benefit_.
